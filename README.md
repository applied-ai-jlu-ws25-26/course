# Applied AI in Risk and Finance

## Overview
This repository hosts the source code of the **Applied AI in Risk and Finance** course. The course is designed to equip participants with practical skills and knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Overall, the course consists of three independent modules focusing on the application of Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI (GenAI) within the context of quantitative risk management. As a hands-on seminar, the course will cover a range of methods and real world use cases relevant to practitioners in the field of Risk and Finance.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: Lecture Series

#### [1. Lecture: Machine Learning and Risk Modeling](1_ml/ml.ipynb)
Participants will learn key ML concepts and algorithms, including:
- **ML pipelines**
- **Tree-based ML algorithms** (e.g., Regression Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Model training and model inference**

The focus will be on a step-by-step process of modeling risks and predicting future uncertain outcomes using popular Python libraries such as **scikit-learn** and **pandas**. The concrete use case looks into the uncertainty of what a leased out car can be resold at the end of the lease term, a typical risk faced by car leasing entities. The goal is to understand how machine learning can add value in assessing risks that organizations operating under uncertainty are facing.

#### [2. Lecture: Natural Language Processing and Risk Clustering](2_nlp/nlp.ipynb)
This session will cover NLP techniques and their evolution in recent years, including:
- **Text Vectorization** (e.g., tf-idf, word embeddings)
- **Text Clustering** via topic modeling

Participants will explore how these techniques can enhance the processing of insurance policies and the categorization of insurance claims both of which being common use cases in the insurance industry. While the use case is specific to insurers, the techniques can be easily adapted to other use cases and industries where professionals are facing unstructured text data.

#### [3. Lecture Generative AI and Risk Agents](3_genai/genai.ipynb)
On the third day, participants will explore the cutting-edge field of Generative AI (GenAI) and its application in risk analytics. The focus will be on building a Multi-Document Risk Agent, a conversational AI system that allows users to interact with and extract insights from annual reports of publicly listed companies. This session will cover:
- Introduction to **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models** (LLMs)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG)
- The concept of **agents**

By the end of the day, participants will have a working understanding of how to leverage GenAI, LLMs, and RAG to create advanced tools for making fast amounts of information accesible in risk management using popular Python frameworks such as **LlamaIndex**, **LangChain** and **LangGraph**.

### Part 2: Take-Home Assignment
After the lecture sessions, participants will work on a practical problem. They will apply the methods learned to evaluate whether and under what constraints a specific real world problem can be solved. Participants will have **2-4 weeks** to complete this assignment and will present their findings in a **presentation** during a follow-up session lasting **1-2 days** (depending on the number of participants).
More details about the take home assignment will be given in the first class.

## Technical Setup
Please follow the steps below to get started with the ccourse material:

1. Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) (or higher) on your local machine.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine.
3. Accept the invitation to the @ai-analytics-jlu-ws25-26 organization that has been sent to you via mail (create a GitHub account if you have not done so already)
4. Clone the repository on your local machine using Git:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/julienOlivier3/risk-analytics.git
    ```
5. Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies into it:
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
6. Activate the newly created virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```
7. Install all required dependencies from the root directory:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
8. Open Jupyter Lab:
    ```
    jupyter lab
    ```
