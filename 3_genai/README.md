# Generative AI in Risk and Finance

## Course Overview

The **Generative AI in Risk and Finance** course aims to provide participants with practical skills in applying Generative AI (GenAI) to quantitative risk management. This hands-on course covers various GenAI concepts, tools, and practical applications.

## Key Learning Objectives

Participants will explore the cutting-edge field of Generative AI (GenAI) and its applications in risk analytics. The course will cover:
- Introduction to **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models** (LLMs)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG)
- The concept of **agents**

By the end of the course, participants will have a working understanding of how to leverage GenAI, LLMs, and RAG to create advanced tools for risk management and decision-making using popular Python libraries.

## Practical Application

A specific use case explored in the course involves building a Multi-Document Risk Agent: a conversational AI system that allows users to interact with and extract insights from annual reports of multiple companies. Participants will design and experiment with GenAI pipelines relevant to risk analytics.

## Technical Setup

1. Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) (or higher) on your local machine.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine.
3. Clone the repository on your local machine using Git:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/julienOlivier3/risk-analytics.git
    ```
4. Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies into it:
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
5. Activate the newly created virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```
      .venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```
6. Install all required dependencies from the root directory:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
7. Open Jupyter Lab:
    ```
    jupyter lab
    ```
8. Open the notebook `genai.ipynb` and start learning.
